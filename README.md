# hello-world
My basic tracking file

I have looked at learning programming for around 3 years now, touched on C++, Python, C#, Javascript and Kotlin, but due to my current job I am having to leave VB.Net, which I know people say is a bad thing to learn first, but its needed for my work (the software we use, uses VB to update and change rules). 
From there I am looking at Java, then Javascript, PHP and finally Kotlin.
I have some experience with HTML, CSS, VBA, SQL (the latter 2 I use daily). So I should be able to pick up VB relatively quickly, I have set myself a 6 month timescale to pick up what I can before even thinking about an additional language (as much as I want to get to Kotlin).
This is the start of a long long road. But I am looking forward to it as I always enjoy building in VBA and SQL.
